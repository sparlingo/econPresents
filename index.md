## Let's get this party started

### First, some ground rules

----

### I'm talking about what is, not what should be

----

### Your spending is my income, and vice versa

__Spending comes first__, income follows

----

### Anyone can create money, the problem is getting it accepted

### Economics is a social science

Social science has a problem, you don't get to run large scale experiments (unless you have a navy)

### SS has only one proven tenet

If a person's salary depends on them not understanding something, they'll find a way to do it

### Panic of 1907

- Financial innovation leads to speculative bubble
- No central bank, no ability to add liquidity to a seized payments system
- 

----

### Great Depression

- Speculative bubble in securities, crash in 1929
- Government pulls back spending post-crash
- Fear, retreat to safety. People hoard gold
- Gold rises in value, dis-inflation. Why spend today, when your money will buy more tomorrow?


----

### Oil Crisis

- Post-war institutions breakdown, capital strike
- Strange combination of low growth, high inflation
- Capital goes on strike, why invest when there's no possiblity of a return?

----

### 1998 Asian Crisis

- Hot money comes in, hot money goes out
- US deficits down, no worldwide safe asset

----

### 2008 Great Financial Crisis

- Financial innovation blows up again, speculative bubble based on "irrational exuberance"

## Schools of Economics

Put a list here

----

### Austrian

* Englightenment Liberals, golden age was between Napoleon and WWI
* Hear no evil see no evil
* Deep belief in the meritocracy, you hurt the poor by helping them
* Against progressive taxation, not-Benthamites
* Correctly point out the problems in the Bismarck welfare state

----

### Keynesian

* Technocrats in the spirit of John Maynard Keynes
* Mathematically rigourous, empirical
* Currently dominant in intermediate micro/macro/trade
* They've made a cult of math, no problem with spending period in the most extreme applications
