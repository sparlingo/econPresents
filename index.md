#### But what IS THAT?

* Stock markets are hemmoraging cash, what does that mean?
* What is the stock market?
* Business? Finance? Economy?

## Let's get this party started

### First, some ground rules

----

### I'm talking about what is, not what should be

> Positive statements vs normative statements

----

### Your spending is my income, and vice versa

__Spending comes first__, income follows

----

### Anyone can create money, the problem is getting it accepted

![Hyman Minsky](./img/minsky.jpg)

----

### Economics is a social science

Social science has a problem, you don't get to run large scale experiments (unless you have a navy)

----

### SS has only one proven tenet

If a person's salary depends on them not understanding something, they'll find a way to do it
> Upton Sinclair Principle

----

### Trades are two-sided

> Every debt is someone else's asset, and vice versa

----

### Our lives will be dominated by...

- Global climate change
- Wealth inequality

## Past crises

| Episode            | CofG   | Effect       | Winners |
| -------- |-------|-------------|---------:|
| Panic of 1907 |US|Europe/Asia/Latin|Neoclassical |
| Great Depression |US|World|Keynesian |
| Oil Crisis |World|World|Freshwater |
| 1998 Asian  | Japan | Asia/Europe/Latin | China    |

----

### Panic of 1907

- Financial innovation leads to speculative bubble
- No central bank, no ability to add liquidity to a seized payments system
- JP Morgan (Mr. Moneybags) bails out several trusts and forces bankers to pool funds to save the NYSE

----

### Lesson from 1907

> Lack of liquidity kills you quick

- Lec 4-5: The Survival Constraint

----

The Panic of 1907 originated with runs on a type of financial intermediary that was mostly outside the payments system, trust companies.  Similar to modern “shadow” banks, trust companies grew rapidly and became important financial intermediaries in the years prior to the crisis.1  Less regulated than commercial banks, trust companies were highly levered, held low cash reserve balances, and issued uninsured liabilities.

----

### The fix is in

1913 Federal Reserve act creates the US Federal Reserve banks, 12 regional banks that act as a "lender of last resort"

----

### Great Depression

- Speculative bubble in securities, crash in 1929
- Government pulls back spending post-crash
- Fear, retreat to safety. People hoard gold
- Gold rises in value, dis-inflation. Why spend today, when your money will buy more tomorrow?

----

### What about the Fed?

- Fed actions were uncoordinated
- Raised interest rates to kill stock speculation, leading to 
money scarcity (excess of discipline)
- Liquidationist policy: let bad institutions fail so that better insts can be created (Mellon)

----

 From the fall of 1930 through the winter of 1933, the money supply fell by nearly 30 percent. The declining supply of funds reduced average prices by an equivalent amount. This deflation increased debt burdens; distorted economic decision-making; reduced consumption; increased unemployment; and forced banks, firms, and individuals into bankruptcy.

----


### Oil Crisis

- Post-war institutions breakdown, capital strike
- Strange combination of low growth, high inflation
- Capital goes on strike, why invest when there's no possiblity of a return?

----

### 1998 Asian Crisis

- Hot money comes in, hot money goes out
- US deficits down, no worldwide safe asset

----

### 2008 Great Financial Crisis

- Financial innovation blows up again, speculative bubble based on "irrational exuberance"

---

# Reality Check

Remember the talk about the latest stock market crash. Was this "Business? Finance? Economy?". What's the connection between the stock market and the "real" economy?
