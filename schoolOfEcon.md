## Schools of Economics

Put a list here

----

### Austrian

* Englightenment Liberals, golden age was between Napoleon and WWI
* Hear no evil see no evil
* Deep belief in the meritocracy, you hurt the poor by helping them
* Against progressive taxation, not-Benthamites
* Correctly point out the problems in the Bismarck welfare state

----

### Keynesian

* Technocrats in the spirit of John Maynard Keynes
* Mathematically rigourous, empirical
* Currently dominant in intermediate micro/macro/trade
* All about animal spirits
* They've made a cult of math, no problem with any and all spending (for some)

----

### Classical 

* Enlightenment thinkers, trying to get out from under the king
* Gave Econ it's later definition as the "Dismal Science"
* Their lessons are mostly incorporated into other schools, but split
* All about rationality
* This is our orthodoxy

----

### Marxist

* Marx is an enlightenment guy too, Hegelian
* Some of the critiques still hold water
* Production: a small share goes to labour with the rest going to capital
* This surplus value is captured the capitalist class grows in power
* Revolution, you have nothing to lose but your chains
